# Citibike Share Analysis 

## Overview of the Project: Analysis on the NYC Citibike Ride Usage

For this project, I was tasked with doing an analysis of the NYC Citibike Rental data for August of 2019. The main purpose of the analysis was to determine the key statistics and demographics and deduce if this would be a viable option to introduce to Des Moines.  

In analyzing the bike usage, the trip duration, statistics about the starting and ending stations and rider information, I can provide a high level overview of the business in NYC and provide some insight about what we need to focus on if we were to introduce this to the greater Des Moines area. You can access the NYC Citibike Tableau Dashboard to examine the data further.

## Results

In examining all of the data and creating multiple visualizations, I want to discuss a few major points about the NYC Citibike business. 

### Summary of Citibike Statistics in NYC
Here is a overall summary of Citibike statistics for the month of August 2019.

As you can see, there are a high number of trips and users. So there is definitely a demand for bikes in NYC. Each bike averages 168 rides per month. 
Additionally, you can see that majority of rides are from subscribers. A subscription creates brand loyalty and promotes return usage. It's a good sign that most users are not simply using the bike once. This helps to prove that there is a need and a definite usage of the business in NYC. 

### Starting and Ending Stations
The NYC Citibike business also has around 800 different stations to pick up and drop off bikes throughout the city. The majority of the starting and ending locations are in Manhattan.

There is less usage in the farther boroughs where most people might use cars or public transportation. This is definitely something to take into account when looking at possible bike stations in Des Moines. 

### Bike Usage by Hour
When looking at the NYC Citibike usage data, you can see that the busiest usage times are at 8-9 am and then again from 4-7pm during the weekdays. I think we can safely infer that the bikes are being used in the morning and evening commute.

When you examine further into the actual trip duration during those hours. You can see that many users' trips last up to an hour.

### Bike Usage by Gender and Usertype
As discussed previously, most of the riders are subscribers. When you dig further into that data, you can see that most subscirbers are males that use the bike during the weekdays.

When you look further into the data, you can see that the most frequent usage is during the commute hours.

#### Summary
In summary, the NYC Citibike has high usage throughout the city. With high usage by subscribers, you can tell it is a sustainable business. Additionally, it is used primarily for commuters, mostly males during the weekdays. 

Before we make any final decisions, I have a few more suggestions of queries we could perform to confirm our suspicions and cement our plans to launch Citibike in Des Moines. 

### User Type Study
I dug further into the User data. I wanted to see if there was a specific age group that used the service. Based in birth year, I did an estimate of birth age of the user to see the usage spread. As you can see, there is some data that might need cleaning with 130 year old subscribers. I think the main subscribers are 20-50 year old males and 20-40 year old females.

### Digging deeper into Station Data
I think it would be worth it to look at the specific station data to see which specific locations were the busiest which would help us determine where the Citibike business gets the most usage. It could give us an idea the amount of bikes that should be housed there at any given time. 

![Busiest_Starting_Stations.png](https://github.com/melaniekelsey/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/Busiest_Starting_Stations.png)

As you can see, Pershing Square North has over 16K rides in the month of August alone. We should find out if there are areas in Des Moines that are similar as possible Bike Station locations. 

I think we have a good start overall. We have a sense of the target customer. We know that we need to advertise the benefits of a subscription. We also need to further examine possible station locations in Des Moines. Looking forward to digging deeper into the data. Not to be corny but "Ride on!"
